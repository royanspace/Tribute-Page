        Shinchan is inspired by the real life kid “Shinnosuke Nohara” who faced death
         in a car accident. His mother “Misae” went in misery and gloom after the son’s 
         death, Misae started sketching Shinchan in his remembrance. She described him 
         frequently, his fun days and all her flash of memory were creatively portrayed 
         in the bundles of sketches she drew. Later, a cartoonist Yoshita Usai gazed at 
         those beautiful drawings and offered to develop these memories into a Japanese 
         magazine daily, which then gained immense ratings and popularity. Shinchan was 
         translated into diverse language and started selling worldwide. The crayons of 
         her mother embraced the emergence of the cartoon series “Crayon Shinchan.”
